# Welcome To The Cookie Clocker Discord Bot

## About
So what started as a dumb idea and a typo has become an actual project that I have sunk too many hours into

This is an incremental game-esque bot for discord, with each message you send updating your 'makers' and giving you clocks. Its technically in a playable state but I wouldn't recommend it right now. After reaching 1 trillion clocks (pretty much impossible right not) you can prestige and get cookies which each give you a 1% boost to production.

This was originally written in just javascript but was rewritten into typescript, thats why there are quite a few places where variables don't specify type. I'm planning on fixing this in the future but its not my highest priority.


## Running
Put your token in `example_config.json` and rename it to `config.json`
Create a folder called `user_data`
Run `npm i` and then `npm start` to install the dependencies and then compile and run the bot.
